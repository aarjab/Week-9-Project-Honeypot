I deployed the  Dionaea with HTTP honeypot. I had multiple issues trying to conduct this week's assignment.
Most of the issues occurred during installation. For example, when I was trying to run the sudo apt-get update command,
I would get multiple issues where it would say the command is not recognized.
I had to google search my error and I discovered a new way to run the command.
Also for milestone 4, I found it hard to navigate through the application when I was trying to deploy the script.
I was able to get 323 attacks in about one hour. The top attack was from this IP: 134.74.132.201. The number of attacks
from 134.74.132.201 was 240 attacks. The protocols that were used in this session was httpd and pcap.
The one question I have from this week's assignment is what is the difference between $oid and id in my .json file?
